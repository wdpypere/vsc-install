Generate and verify headers from scripts and modules

This module has a very primitive main routine:
    REPO_BASE_DIR=$PWD python -m vsc.install.headers path/to/file [script_or_not]

    Will write the header to the file as it is supposed to be
    (the optional script or not is a simple 1 or 0).

    REPO_BASE_DIR=$PWD assumes you run this from the base repo
